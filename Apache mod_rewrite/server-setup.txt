First Time Setup:
apt-get install apache2
a2enmod rewrite proxy proxy_http 
nano /etc/apache2/apache.conf
Change "AllowOverride None" to "AllowOverride All" in the directory setting you will be serving your malicious page from

service apache2 restart

Now place the .htaccess file for the redirection you'd like to perform in the web root of your server.
	- .htaccess files apply to all subdirectories unless overriden by another .htaccess file


--- Mobile User Redirection ---
Line 3: Change http://TEAMSERVER-WAN-IP/MOBILE-PROFILER-PATH to the path you'd like served to mobile devices
Line 4: Change http://TEAMSERVER-WAN-IP to your Cobalt Strike teamserver's IP. The original request URI will be sent to the teamserver


--- Invalid URI Redirection ---
Line 2: Change profiler and payload to any URIs you would like to allow through. Seperate all paths by a pipe "|" character.
Line 3: Change http://SPOOFED-DOMAIN\.com to the URL you the user visits to access this server. Be sure to escape the period in the '.com'
Line 4: Change http://TEAMSERVER-IP to your Cobalt Strike teamserver's IP. The original request URI will be sent to the teamserver
Line 5: Change http://REDIRECTION-URL.com/ to the URL you would like users to be directed to if an invalid URI is requested. This can be the target company's domain or 404 page.


--- Operating System Based Redirection ---
Host os-detector.html on your Cobalt Strike teamserver.

In the .htaccess file, change the URLs on lines 3, 5, 7, and 9 to payloads that correspond to the detected operating system.
Line 11: Change the URL to the path you would like to send an unknown or undetecting operating system to
Line 12: Change the URL to the hosted path of the os-detector.html page
